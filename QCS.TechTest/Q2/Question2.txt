Question 2:

Refactor the code in this namespace to achieve 2 goals:
 
    1. Make the Bartender and Cocktail classes static
    2. Remove the AddGarnish method from the Glass class

 
You must also obey the following 3 rules while refactoring:
 
    A. Ensure the Martini's ingredients do not change
    B. Ensure the Bartender can't add the Garnish before the Spirits
    C. Do not add or remove any classes or allow any empty classes
